# bcnfs.org site
Our site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

## Development

We use [bundler](https://bundler.io/) to manage the dependencies. First, install it with `gem install bundler`.

Now, navigate to this folder and install Jekyll and the other deps with `bundle install`.

Run the development server with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
