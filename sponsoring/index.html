        <p class="baseText">The Barcelona Free Software group organizes presentations and discussions about <strong>Free and Open Source software</strong> in Barcelona. Our main mission is to gather and enrich the flourishing technology community in the area.</p>
        <p class="baseText">We do this by making sure that projects have a channel to explain what they do and by facilitating the encounter with possible <strong>new collaborators</strong>. This happens in a relaxed atmosphere where problems get to be solved and connections can be made.</p>

        <p class="baseText">To make sure the group is sustainable, we've set up the following sponsorship program, with two levels of sponsorship.</p>
